\name{\cOldest{}}

You are \cOldest{intro}, the eldest child of \cGrandma{\intro}, and a \cOldest{\offspring} fit to carry on the family name of villainy.  
From childhood, you learned to wield the powers of ice and cold to inspire fear in your enemies, subtle or overt: an innocent-looking patch of black ice here, an icicle to the throat there...all very much the same.  Just like \cGrandma{\Parent} would do.

\TODO{Describe your relationship to your siblings and to your \cGrandma{\parent}.}

Your life took a sharp turn twenty-two years ago, however, as you sought out a territory to claim as your own.  In the streets of \pCityO{}, you found yourself locked in combat with the heroic \cOS{\intro}, a fiery \cOS{\hero} wielding powers over electricity.  You battled for hours, until they finally wrestled you to the ground -- and then you found yourselves locked into a passionate embrace.  What can you say?  \cOS{} is, honestly, extraordinarily hot for a hero.

A strange sort of relationship blossomed.  You have always been on opposite sides of the battle for good and evil, and you are constantly striving with \cOS{\them} for control of the streets of \pCityO{}, but you can't bring yourself to do \cOS{\them} any lasting harm, and the times you've managed to tie \cOS{\them} up -- or \cOS{\they} have tied you up -- have not ended in a cell, but the bedroom.

Nine months after that first encounter, you both had a surprise -- a \cGrad{\offspring}, \cGrad{\intro}.  You and \cOS{} negotiated a part-time truce -- a few days a week -- to try to have some sort of relationship, and raise your \cGrad{\offspring}.  The effectiveness of that arrangement has waxed and waned over the years, largely due to the amount of time you spend fighting, and the amount of time you spend in the bedroom.  Or on the roofs of buildings.  It's that sort of a relationship.

\TODO{Describe what life looks like in \pCityO{}, when you control the city versus when \cOS{} does.  It probably won't look that different, though.}

Even though you fight with \cOS{} over \pCityO{}, you're in perfect agreement that if anyone controls \pCityO{}, it is going to be one of you two.  Villains and heroes alike who have tried to muscle in on \pCityO{} have found themselves simultaneously beset by bolts of electricity and hails of icicles.

Despite your incomplete control of \pCityO{}, you have, through steady skimming of protection fees and other resources, gained significant rank in the Villain Compact.  You've recently been offered a promotion to Secretary -- if you can prove yourself.  The Compact has bid for your \cArchitect{\sibling} \cArchitect{}'s assistance in building a new national villain headquarters, but \cArchitect{} has not yet accepted the offer.  \cArchitect{} may be too difficult to threaten directly, with their ability to nullify your powers, but you think you might be able to add some spice to the deal, perhaps by offering some interesting items, cash, or, perhaps, doing something nice for one of \cArchitect{}'s kids.  They're pretty nice kids, actually, and they've shown interesting hints of potential villainy.  Perhaps you could recruit them into the Junior Villains League?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Do not allow anyone other than you or \cOS{} to interfere with \pCityO{}.
	\item Coordinating with your minions in \pCityO{}, avoid letting \cOS{} manage to take control of the city while you're gone.
	\item Improve your application to become Secretary of the Villain Compact through as many of these objectives as you can complete:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Convince \cArchitect{} to accept the Villain Compact's bid for \cArchitect{\their} services in constructing a new HQ.
		\item Several of your extended family might be interested in a career in villainy.  Convince as many as possible to join the Villain Compact, or for the younger set, the Junior Villains League.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You do like your family...even the heroes, you suppose.  You're not likely to make personal threats against them or their loved ones.  On the other hand, if you find they've left freeze rays or valuables where you or your minions can get at them...well, you \emph{are} a \cOldest{\villain}.
	\item While you find \cOS{} extremely hot, you're among family.  Displays of aggressive affection will not be appropriate.  (Translated: don't make the other players uncomfortable.)
\end{itemz}
