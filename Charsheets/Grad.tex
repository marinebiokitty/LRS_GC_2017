You are \cGrad{\intro}, the \cGrad{\offspring} of the \cOldest{\villain} \cOldest{\intro} and the \cOS{\hero} \cOS{\intro}.  Your parents have fought and bickered constantly since well before you were born, though you realized as you grew older that...honestly, they're just really attracted to each other.  They worked out an arrangement where they called a truce a few days a week to have a relationship, if you can call it that, and raise you.  The other part of the time, you were raised by a nanny.  You're not sure if your powers of invisibility were caused by your feelings of being overlooked as a child, or if it was the other way around -- if you accidentally went invisible so often your parents didn't even see you.  

Your parents sent you off to \pSuperSchool{}, and but then you went on to college, where you were finally free of your parents' shadow and free of their constant bickering.  Finally on your own, you found yourself taking fashion design courses, and invited to join a group of students creating a startup to design superhero -- and perhaps supervillain -- costumes, designed to provide mobility, endurance, and other features useful to any superhuman.  Finally, you had a group of friends, people you shared goals with, people who understood you, a place you could contribute --

-- until you graduated, and had to come home.  You couldn't afford to live anywhere else, not yet.  The startup hasn't taken off yet, not enough to help you find a place to live, and you weren't ready to ask your parents for money.  You've been moping around the house they share when not fighting with each other for a few weeks, now, hating being home and hating being back around your parents' bickering again.

They towed you along to this family reunion, which you grudgingly went along with.  But now that you're here, you realize that there are other people in the family who could help you come back to the startup and get things moving -- an endorsement, a prominent superhuman wearing one of your costumes, or even just initial investment could make the difference between the dream of a few college students and a blossoming career.

You've felt more enthused about your startup than about going into heroism or villainy -- either choice would probably lead to a shouting match with one of your parents, but you might need to pick a side to get an endorsement.  \cGrandma{} has mentioned to you -- very quietly -- that there may be some opportunities for you and your cousins to impress \cGrandma{\them} at this family reunion...and while \cGrandma{} \cGrandma{\themself} is a very classy dresser, \cGrandma{\their} minions' uniforms seem to be decidedly drab.  Alternately, your \cYoungest{\uncle} \cYoungest{} seems to be a prominent figure in the League of Heroes; \cYoungest{\they} might be a useful investor.

You spent some time with your cousins \cTeen{} and \cTween{} before going off to college, but you haven't seen them in several years.  They're pretty bright, though, and seem to have a pretty good relationship with their \cArchitect{\parent}, your \cArchitect{\uncle} \cArchitect{}.  You know a secret about \cArchitect{}, though -- \TODO{describe overseeing the Chicago Incident}.  Even so, you can't bear to tell \cTeen{} and \cTween{} -- you would hate to see your cousins as estranged from their \cArchitect{\parent} as you are from your parents.
