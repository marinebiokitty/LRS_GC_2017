Your name is \cTeen{} and you are 16 years old. The best part about your life is your power. You have an innate knowledge of how to build gadgets and super-tech. Your skill grows with ever passing project and some of your latest triumph have included an ice and heat ray. Your \cOldest{\uncle} help provide the necessary starting material for your ice ray and it was not too hard to create heat ray afterward. 

You attend \pNormalSchool a non-super high school in \pCityArchitect, which actually is mostly ok for you. You have friends and enjoy being the center of attention. You \textsl{could} be the top of your classes if you choose, but really don't see the point. As long as, this class work does not get in the way of your actual work with building cool stuff its all fine. Another reason you like your school is that you feel like the ruler of a very small realm here, which admittedly is nice. The other students cannot match the pace at which you make your gadgets. You became a local legend last week by freezing an annoying sub during class. It was worth the suspension and the lecture by your parent, \cArchitect. Though, your heat and freeze rays have been taken though and that sucks. 

However your sights are set much higher. You want to live as a super. You are ok not attending \pSuperSchool because you are afraid your talent would not be recognized and you would be slotted into the sidekick track and not the main super track. You are \textbf{not} a sidekick. You have been biding your time and honing your skills so you can debut as a super while in college. In private, you have sketch out what your costume and theme music might be. Its good to be prepared. You have even dressed up in non-descript clothes to try and pull some pranks.  They went mostly fine -- your gadgets only sometimes blow up.  It is all in the service of learning. If you don't push yourself and tools into ever more extreme and varied situations, how can you be prepared.  

\cGrandma{} is your grandma and is a famous villain. You think she is pretty cool.
