You were born in a normal family , one without superpowers. Sometimes that happens and it's usually not that happy of a story. Your parents were happy that you exhibited powers, since that was a way to rise in the world. You would have an easy life, they said. 

People often ask how it happened. After all, if you had never come into contact with any supers you might never have known. One day, you were in elementary school and the building caught fire. The superhero of the city swooped into save the children, but there were too many and the fire was spreading fast. By the time they had gotten to you, they were exhausted and barely flying but as soon as you made contact they regained energy in a large burst. 

Then they took you to the scientists of the superhero community, who poked and prodded and made you do different experiments with different superpowered beings until they knew the ins and outs of all your abilities. You were taken in and sponsored by the superhero with flight in your city. From then on, you were drilled into the ground by trainers. You were trained as a badass normal to be able to survive in super-fights as an ally instead of just being a weak point. As a result, you can beat most supers in the community without their powers and it's still a fair fight even with their powers.  

You weren't very social in \pSuperSchool{} because your minders never liked you socializing too much. You do remember \cYoungest{} though, the universally liked one. You don't know what \cYoungest{} sees in you, but \cYoungest{} is one of the few superpeople who don't feel like they're trying to use you. 

Even after you graduated, it felt like the Superhero community was so fake. They used you and failed to protect you. Once, while interning in \pCityO{} , you supercharged \cJuggernaut{} too much and killed the sewage system. \cJuggernaut{} was another one of those popular jocks and a child of another superhero on the council. Your sponsor died in action shortly after, and you lost the only link you really had to the Hero community. You know it was \cOS{} city that you wrecked, but you were too scared then to apologise. You wonder if \cOS{} will be able to forgive you, or what you will have to do to make things right. 

You went dark, studying Psychology and writing copy for cheap for some papers and making friends with petty Villains. The Editor of the newspaper recognized that they could use you and eventually after reporting and informing for a while, published the piece that forced you out into the open even if it was a pseudonym. That was a betrayal. You couldn't remain in the Villain community any longer. You did still have a path in reporting and it was something that you liked. You moved to \pCityY{} to start over. 

Eventually, they still found out and you were pushed into covering the super community again. The super community was happy o bring to back into the fold to use the you as a battery. Even though you've learned to read people and how to protect yourself, trust is still hard. 

Until you met \cYoungest{}. \cYoungest{} is actually genuine. But deep deep down you don't know if it’s because \cYoungest{}  the popular kid, but you feel like you don't deserve this person. You also know that \cYoungest{} will be upset and hurt that you didn’t trust them enough. 

You are very very nervous about meeting \cYoungest{} family. There’s the great opportunity to get to know some of the biggest names in the business, \cGrandma{} is a legend. You would also love to be able to interview to interview \cOldest and \cOS one of the most famous Villain-Hero couples. There's a story in all of those that your Editor will pay you quite bit for.
