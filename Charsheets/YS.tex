People often ask how it happened. You were born in a normal family, one without any supers. After all, if you had never come into contact with any supers you might never have known that your power could significantly augment other peoples powers. Foolishly, your parents celebrated your powers since that was a way to rise in the world. You would have an easy life, they said. They were happy to give you away to the first hero that came calling. 

You will always curse your elementary school science fair to the end of your days. One of the experiments toppled into the other, causing the building to catch fire. The superhero of the city swooped into save the children, but there were too many and the fire was spreading fast. By the time they had gotten to you, they were exhausted and barely flying. When they reached out to you, all you felt was a burst of white light behind your eyes as you passed out. 

They took you to the scientists of the superhero community, who poked and prodded and made you do different experiments with different superpowered beings until they knew the ins and outs of all your abilities. You were taken in and sponsored by the superhero with flight in your city. They paid for your lessons, did your paperwork and took care of you in exchange for power-ups. They paid for your training so you would be able to survive in super-fights as an ally instead of just being a weak point. As a result, you can beat most supers in the community without their powers and many of them even when they do use their powers. Because you know what they're going to do next.  

They sent you to school with the rest of the powered children, but you weren't very social in \pSuperSchool{} because your minders never liked you socializing too much. You had a hard time making friends. You do remember \cYoungest{} though, the universally liked one who was friends with everyone. 

Even after you graduated, it felt like the Superhero community was so fake.Once, while interning in \pCityO{} , you supercharged \cJuggernaut{} too much and caused the Chicago Incident. \cJuggernaut{} was another one of those popular jocks and a child of another superhero on the Council. You know it was \cOS{} city that you wrecked, but you were too scared then to apologise. You wonder if \cOS{} will be able to forgive you, or what you will have to do to make things right. The League used you and failed to protect you. You were benched permanently and forbidden from using your powers without consent from the Council. When your sponsor died in action, and you lost the only link you really had to the Hero community. 

You decided to leave and went dark, studying Psychology and writing for cheap, and making friends with petty criminals. The Editor of the local newspaper recognized that they could use you and eventually after reporting and informing for a while, published the piece that put your friends in prison. Even though you were writing under a pseudonym, you couldn't face them again. You ran away. 

You moved to \pCityY{} to start over, but still got pulled back into the powered community through your reporting job. Those pieces paid the best, and you can't deny that there's a certain pleasure you get from exposing the hypocrisy of those in the League one by one. \cYoungest{} was one of the few left, the spotless one, so you chose another hero name and got yourself signed up for the emotional support group run by \cYoungest{}. 

Even though you've learned to read people and how to protect yourself, trust was still hard. And to fit into the group you had to open yourself up. Somehow you found yourself doing that with \cYoungest{} telling \cYoungest{} more and more about yourself even though you were supposed to be finding out more about them. You don't know what \cYoungest{} sees in you, but \cYoungest{} is one of the few superpeople who does not feel like they're trying to use you. \cYoungest{} makes you feel safe. However, you don't know if you really love them, or love way your position has changed once you've gotten with the popular kid. Then again, you might really love \cYoungest{}. 

Since the article on Youngest has gone caput, you need to find another feature to fill its place and your Editor has been on your back for a while. Just another week you tell her, and hope that you will be able to get something at this dinner. You are very very nervous about meeting \cYoungest{} family. Thereâ€™s the great opportunity to get to know some of the biggest names in the business, \cGrandma{} is a legend. You would also love to be able to interview to interview \cOldest and \cOS one of the most famous Villain-Hero couples. Either way there's a story in this family your Editor will pay you quite bit for.
