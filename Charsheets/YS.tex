You were born in a normal family , one without superpowers. Sometimes that happens and it's usually not that happy of a story. Your parents were happy that you exhibited powers, since that was a way to rise in the world. You would have an easy life, they said. 

People often ask how it happened. After all, if you had never come into contact with any supers you might never have known. One day, you were in elementary school and the building caught fire. The superhero of the city swooped into save the children, but there were too many and the fire was spreading fast. By the time they had gotten to you, they were exhausted and barely flying but as soon as you made contact they regained energy in a large burst. 

Then they took you to the scientists of the superhero community, who poked and prodded and made you do different experiments with different superpowered beings until they knew the ins and outs of all your abilities. You were taken in and sponsored by the superhero with flight in your city. From then on, you were drilled into the ground by trainers. You were trained as a badass normal to be able to survive in super-fights as an ally instead of just being a weak point.

Hendricks power is strange, it doesn’t work without another super. Once upon a time, while interning with OS, supercharged a Juggernaut type *too much* and helped cause a lot of property damage. It’s alway been hard for Hendricks, even to this day to see how powerful the other is an to add to appropriate amount of juice. This was 10 years ago and led Hendricks to studying psychology.  

Psychology was something that captivated Hendrick, and became an obsession. Hendricks began to study the superhero personalities, trying to crack them apart.

A lot of people have tried to use Hendricks powers for themselves, but Hendricks has learned how to read people. Hendricks has learned how to say no. 

Jamie is actually genuine. And deep deep down, Hendricks doesn’t know if it’s just because Jamie is the popular kid. Hendricks doesn’t know if they deserve to be happy. Hendricks also know that Jamie will be upset and hurt that Hendricks didn’t trust them enough. After all, Jamie has laid bare Jamie’s soul. 

Neurotic, Obsessive, A good person deep down, judgemental, quick to jump to conclusions.
