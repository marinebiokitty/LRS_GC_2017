Hi My Name is Grandma

The very first thing you stole was a puzzle box. You were 5. It caught your eye as you were pulled along by your mother to somewhere expensive. The box was small a gilded enameled Victorian sort of thing that was valuable enough to be locked up and displayed in its glass case, but not so much that anyone would notice. 

Thus began your illustrious career in theft. At first, it was small things that no noticed. How could you resist, after all you could simply just reach through all the barriers and have anything you wanted. Your favorites were pieces of art, robust Rubenesque pieces with vivid colors so often sitting in private collections gathering dust and being unloved and under-appreciated. 

For a while you worked under the radar,  but when you were 12, you stole a set of diamond earrings 6 carats from one of the girls at your country club and realized that her shrieks and the thrill of discovery gave you even more of a thrill. Stealing with your powers had become too easy and too subtle. 

Your parents sent you to Super High hoping that they would be able to control you. They were unsuccessful. You felt that Super High cramped your style, and the simpering flocks of geese who tried to make you their queen bee, well they were all so pathetic. You should have gone to art school, where you could be around beautiful things and break the rules all the time. You resented the fact that your parents thought that Super High was the only place for you. 

While at Super High you became obsessed with escapology and Houdini. At 19 years old, you ran away from home to Gogopolis and joined a magician’s act. You rose through the ranks and acquired a keen understanding of how to perform, and what people want to see and eventually took over the act itself.  

In those years, you still continued to visit the big museums in the city, and by visit you mean rob. You would sometimes steal art supplies and leave them as an anonymous gift for artist you thought seems promising. 

One night, during a show you looked out in the crowd and locked eyes with a man. You would find out late that he was known to public as Inferno, the super villain terrorizing the extended area of Oldtown. You were just 24 and even though you swiped his wallet that night, he took your heart.

For their honeymoon, he took you to Vegas and together you looted the casinos blind. He built you your first super-lair, with no doors and as you filled with art and culture and the things that you stole together, for a while you were happy. 

It didn't last long. You loved each other fiercely but also cruelly. Grandpa trained you up and pushed you to be better at stealing, more villainous. Being with him meant that you had to be part of the larger world of super-villainy, that Villain Compact group that you had tried so hard to leave behind in Super High. Still, you made lemons out of lemonade to this very day, the Villains still speak your name with reverence, especially about the Incident of '62. 

During this decade, you became pregnant with Oldest and then Architect. When Oldest was small enough to be carried around in a sling, you took Oldest with you on heists. However, when she was pregnant with Architect you were benched at home and helpless, unable to use your powers.  At first, you freaked out, thought you were losing your powers. You slammed face first into a wall more than once.

Oldest had so much promise, and had a special place in your heart as your firstborn. But He stole Oldest for his protege and groomed Oldest to eventually take over Oldtown. He became jealous of your prestige, or perhaps you were jealous of each other. The attraction was still there, but it was more often fueled by resentment and trying to get a hand over each other.  You both tried to keep up a good front for the children, but things spilled over, especially as Oldest left for College. 

Your husband passed away shortly after Youngest was born. And you felt... relief. This child would be yours to mold and make. You also hit your second spring in those years, they were some of the most productive years in your life and you widened and deepened your control over Gogopolis until no one could shake it. No hero or villain was your match. 

You were furious when Youngest decided to become a hero. But at the same time you were proud. You took out these feelings by exploding Youngest’s childhood bedroom. That was a work of art. 

But suddenly you’ve become old. Where did all those years go? Half a century of being a villain, and you’ve never gotten the chance to pursue your other hobbies. It’s been almost a decade now since he passed away. Recently you took a hit to the knee and had actually take a gun from a henchman and you it to threaten your foes. You’ve never had a taste for violence, it’s far to vulgar. The added insult is that now you have to use a cane to walk long distances, even though it is a good prop. Oldest even had the audacity to use the word “retirement”! You aren’t being respected enough by the “modern” supers who think that their gadgets and fancy technology are the solution, the only thing you can rely on are your wits. 

You've got a plan. You're  going to outsmart and out-plan them, and see what they say then! 

Nowadays you often has to rely on minions, and even good minions are hard to come by now. You haven't seen your other children and grandchildren in some time and wonder how they are. Are they still so easily manipulated? You desperately need a good side-kick who preferably can patiently deal with numbskulls.  At least you have a few talented Grandchildren to pick from. Finally the engagement rings will be put to good use to communicate with your sidekick, whoever that turns out to be. 

You have planned a beautiful obstacle course for your grandchildren. Something that plays to your grandchildren’s talents. 

Watched the Avengers, decided that Thor is what you need in your life. Fetched Chris Hemsworth from his trailer and locked him up in your lair for enjoyment.
