\name{\cYoungest{}}

As a child, you were raised by \cGrandma{} who allowed you as much freedom as you wanted. \cGrandma{} taught you how to manipulate all kinds of locks and all kind of people. You often feel guilty that you didn't follow in her footsteps, but you know that she's proud of your choice. Sometimes, you do wonder if you should have chosen your friends over your family. 

It happened like this. Four years in \pSuperSchool{} were some of the best years  of your life, you thrived in an environment where you were able to make new friends and impress your teachers. You and your best friends formed The Super 5! to fight petty crime in the streets and get dates for prom. Unexpectedly, the group blew up and you did a lot of good. You fed off the adoration of the public and the way people called you a hero. This was what it was you always imagined your life to be like.  
 
After The Super 5! disbanded, you went on through the Superhero Compact to intern for more heroes and eventually joined the Heroes as an official member. Recently, you've even risen to Social Chair, something that you owe to all the excellent PR stories the League has been able to tell about your exploits. You're a dating a wonderful person. You should be happy. 

But you aren't. You know that you are the poster child for going good.  Everyone on the League said that you did right thing by deciding to break with your super villain relatives. That makes it even harder for you to walk this tightrope and keep up this farce. You love your family is that such a terrible thing? You wish you could tell everyone, but your teammates are always prattling on about PR. You know you have to keep the PR of the Superhero League high, otherwise you might lose the adoration of your fans and your friends. Primarily that consists of avoiding journalists, as you are very protective of your privacy. 

A lot of other thoughts have been occupying your mind. Two years ago, you took it upon yourself to mentor some of the more troubled members of the Hero League. That's when you met \cYS{} and fell head over cape. At first, you didn't even notice \cYS{} in the group you were running until \cYS{} got in a fight one session about the Chicago Incident. The Chicago Incident was one of the worst in Superhero history, a blemish upon the League that continued to affect the emotions of many who had lost someone in the carnage. \cArchitect{} had lost their spouse \cAS{}. One of the worst memories you have about the post-Chicago Incident period is the incessant amount of questions you were asked by the media every time you set foot outside the house. One of them even tried to flirt with you! You really hate reporters.  

You started to have one-on-one counseling sessions with \cYS{} and even though it took some time, you feel like you finally got through to them. \cYS{} seemed to be happier in the League and there were less conflicts.  All\cYS{} really needed was someone to try and reach out to them. And then, things just took their natural course. You realized that \cYS{} was a person that you thought about every day. Even though you still don't totally understand  \cYS {\them}, you're confident that \cYS{} doesn't lie to you at least. But maybe if you figured out what happened to \cYS{} you might be able to help them move past it. 
 
Recently the spate of press exposures on scandals in the hero community has shaken you to your very core. What will happen if the press discredits the League? If there is no League then you won't have any friends, you won't be loved anymore, what will you do? This is when started thinking about asking \cYS{} to marry you. You think that this might be what is missing in your life. But you can't propose yet because you need the rings. When \cGS{} proposed to \cGrandma{}, he challenged her to complete a heist on the most expensive jeweler in town. When \cGrandma{} opened the box, she saw the rings that he had commissioned, two square cut 8 carat milochite stones, rare gems that enabled the wearer to communicate with each other over long distances.  \cGrandma{} hasn't worn those stones for a long time. 

You were surprised when \cGrandma{} called this dinner, but happy because this is a perfect opportunity to introduce \cYS{} to the rest of the family. You aren't sure what they will think and really do care about what \cGrandma{} will say. 

This dinner is also good time to get some tasks done. Firstly, the League has tasked you with finding an architect to build the new HQ. You have the perfect candidate and have full confidence that \cArchitect{} will be persuaded to build the hero HQ. Even worse, now you've been tasked with convincing your family to do things that they probably don't want to do. 

You are always happy to mentor new heroes and recruit them. Your nieces and nephews are coming up on important decisions in their lives and you want to help guide them. It's time for \cGrad{} and \cTeen{} to join the fold. You think that \cTween{} will have a great experience at \pSuperSchool{} because in your opinion \pSuperSchool{} is the best place on this earth for budding supers. 

Unfortunately, you have also been tasked with passing on the message to Grandma to be good. Your mother is a force of nature, but really the superhero on duty is \pCityGrandma{} is never able to last out the year. You don't want to be reassigned to be the hero counter your mother if they run out of candidates. 

Luckily you're a popular person to side-kick or city-sit for, which is why nothing bad is going to happy while you're away. You trust that the League will make everything right.
