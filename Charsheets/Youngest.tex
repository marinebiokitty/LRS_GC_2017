You know that you’re the poster child for going good.  Everyone on the Superhero Ultimate Team said that you were doing the right thing by deciding to break with your super villain relatives. But what if the public knew that you still loved your mother and your sibling despite their villainy? You wish you could tell everyone, but your teammates are always prattling on about PR.  It's a constant tightrope you walk, but you believe in doing the right thing and in the importance of family. 

As a child you adored the traditions of super-ing. Adoration and attention came easily to you, and in retrospect you can sometimes admit to yourself that you were a bit spoiled. You never really knew your father, but he was this looming figure of power in your family's history, someone who was spoken of in reverence. Naturally, you imagined this beautiful romantic story for your parents relationship that lasted for four decades until your father's demise. You are sure that you've found your soulmate in \cYS{}. 

\cGrandma{} taught you how to pick all kinds of locks and she taught you how to win. Four years in \pSuperSchool{} were some of the best years  of your life. You and your best friends formed The Super 5! and this was the start of you becoming a hero. At the time, you fed off the adoration of the public and the way people looked to you for leadership. Even after The Super 5! disbanded, you went on through the Superhero Compact to intern for more heroes and eventually joined the Heroes as an official member. Recently, you've even risen to Social Chair.  You know you're a popular person to side-kick or city-sit for, which is why you're not worried at all about this dinner. 

A lot of other thoughts have been occupying your mind. Two years ago, you took it upon yourself to mentor some of the more troubled members of the Hero! Community. That's when you met \cYS{} and fell head over cape.  Even though you don't understand \cYS{} sometimes.  

But you can't propose yet because you need the rings. When \cGS{} proposed to \cGrandma{}, he challenged her to complete a heist on the most expensive jeweler in town. When \cGrandma{} opened the box, she saw the rings that he had commissioned, two square cut 8 carat milochite stones, rare gems that enabled the wearer to communicate with each other over long distances.  \cGrandma{} hasn't worn those stones for a long time out of grief you assume. 

You were surprised when \cGrandma{} called this dinner, but happy because this is a perfect opportunity to introduce YS to the rest of the family. This dinner is also good time  to get some tasks done. Firstly, the Hero! Community has tasked you with finding an architect to build the new HQ. You have the perfect candidate and  have full confidence that \cArchitect{} will be persuaded to build the hero HQ. You are always happy to mentor new heroes and recruit them because in your opinion \pSuperSchool{} is the best place on this earth for budding supers. Unfortunately, you have also been tasked with passing on the message to Grandma to be good. Your mother is a force of nature, but really the superhero on duty is \pCityGrandma{} is never able to last out the year. You don't want to be reassigned to be the hero counter your mother if they run out of candidates.
