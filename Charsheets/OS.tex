\name{\cOS{}}
You are \cOS{\intro}, the nationally-known \cOS{\hero} of \pCityO{}, defender of its citizenry and upholder of its laws...sort of.

You first set foot in \pCityO{} twenty-two years ago, a young \cOS{\hero} trying to find \cOS{\themself}, and find a cause.  You quickly became aware of the presence of a shadowy villain, \cOldest{\intro}, and went forth to confront them openly.  You found yourself locked in combat with \cOS{}, brawling through the streets of \pCityO{}, wielding your power over electricity against \cOldest{\their} powers over ice.  You battled for hours, until you finally wrestled \cOldest{\them} to the ground -- and then you found yourselves locked into a passionate embrace.  What can you say?  For a villain, \cOldest{} is dashing, audacious, and...quite attractive, honestly.

A strange sort of relationship blossomed.  You have always been on opposite sides of the battle for good and evil, and you are constantly striving with \cOS{\them} for control of the streets of \pCityO{}, but you can't bring yourself to do \cOS{\them} any lasting harm, and the times you've managed to tie \cOS{\them} up -- or \cOS{\they} have tied you up -- have ended in a bedroom, not a cell.

Nine months after that first encounter, you both had a surprise -- a \cGrad{\offspring}, \cGrad{\intro}.  You and \cOS{} negotiated a part-time truce -- a few days a week -- to try to have some sort of relationship, and raise your \cGrad{\offspring}.  The effectiveness of that arrangement has waxed and waned over the years, largely due to the amount of time you spend fighting, and the amount of time you spend in the bedroom.  Or on the roofs of buildings.  It's that sort of a relationship.  As a result, you often overlooked \cGrad{} while they were growing up.  You started realizing just how bad it was only when \cGrad{} went off to college.  Now, however, \cGrad{} has graduated and moved back home.  You have hopes of reconciling with \cGrad{\them} and trying to make up for lost time, but you're a little confused what \cGrad{\they} are up to.  \cGrad{\They} haven't gone off to become a hero \emph{or} a villain -- instead, they're just hanging around the house you share with \cOS{} when you're not fighting, and you don't see them very often.

You are a member of the League of Heroes, but not a particularly enthusiastic one.  Years ago, they assigned you some mentees -- \cJuggernaut{}, and \cYS{} -- and they ended up doing more damage than the villains.  \cYS{} used \cYS{\their} power to supercharge \cJuggernaut{}, and \cJuggernaut{} ended up crashing through an entire city block.  \TODO{describe the death of AS}  You're inclined to let the heroes who know an area stick to their own territories, rather than trying to send heroes all over the world freelancing.  Being a member of the League gets you indemnity from property damage lawsuits and means you can at least tell the League you have \pCityO{} under control
