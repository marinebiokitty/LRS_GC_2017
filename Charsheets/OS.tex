\name{\cOS{}}
You are \cOS{\intro}, the nationally-known \cOS{\hero} of \pCityO{}, defender of its citizenry and upholder of its laws...sort of.

You first set foot in \pCityO{} twenty-two years ago, a young \cOS{\hero} trying to find \cOS{\themself}, and find a cause.  You quickly became aware of the presence of a shadowy villain, \cOldest{\intro}, and went forth to confront them openly.  You found yourself locked in combat with \cOS{}, brawling through the streets of \pCityO{}, wielding your power over electricity against \cOldest{\their} powers over ice.  You battled for hours, until you finally wrestled \cOldest{\them} to the ground -- and then you found yourselves locked into a passionate embrace.  What can you say?  For a villain, \cOldest{} is dashing, audacious, and...quite attractive, honestly.

A strange sort of relationship blossomed.  You have always been on opposite sides of the battle for good and evil, and you are constantly striving with \cOS{\them} for control of the streets of \pCityO{}, but you can't bring yourself to do \cOS{\them} any lasting harm, and the times you've managed to tie \cOS{\them} up -- or \cOS{\they} have tied you up -- have ended in a bedroom, not a cell.

Nine months after that first encounter, you both had a surprise -- a \cGrad{\offspring}, \cGrad{\intro}.  You and \cOldest{} negotiated a part-time truce -- a few days a week -- to try to have some sort of relationship, and raise your \cGrad{\offspring}.  The effectiveness of that arrangement has waxed and waned over the years, largely due to the amount of time you spend fighting, and the amount of time you spend in the bedroom.  Or on the roofs of buildings.  It's that sort of a relationship.  As a result, you often overlooked \cGrad{} while \cGrad{\theywere} growing up.  You started realizing just how bad it was only when \cGrad{} went off to college.  Now, however, \cGrad{} has graduated and moved back home.  You have hopes of reconciling with \cGrad{\them} and trying to make up for lost time, but you're a little confused what \cGrad{\theyare} up to.  \cGrad{\Theyhave} not gone off to become a hero \emph{or} a villain -- instead, \cGrad{\theyare} just hanging around the house you share with \cOS{} when you're not fighting, and you don't see \cGrad{\them} very often.

Recently, \cGrandma{\intro}, \cGrandma{\villain} and \cGrandma{\familyleader} of the \TODO{family name} family, asked \cGrandma{\their} entire family to join \cGrandma{\them} at \cGrandma{\their} lair in \pCityGrandma{}.  You received an invitation, too -- probably because \cGrandma{\they} knew you wouldn't want \cGrad{} to go without you, and because they all consider you a sort of family.  You decided to come along, hoping to find time to bond with \cGrad{}, and to play role model for the younger generation.  You'd hate to see the \emph{whole} family go villainous if you can help it.

You are a member of the League of Heroes, but not a particularly enthusiastic one.  Years ago, they assigned you some mentees -- \cJuggernaut{}, and \cYS{} -- and they ended up doing more damage than the villains.  \cYS{} used \cYS{\their} power to supercharge \cJuggernaut{}, and \cJuggernaut{} ended up crashing through an entire city block.  \TODO{describe the death of AS}  You're inclined to let the heroes who know an area stick to their own territories, rather than trying to send heroes all over the world freelancing.  Being a member of the League gets you indemnity from property damage lawsuits and means you can at least tell the League you have \pCityO{} under control.  You and \cOldest{} between you know the city and know how not to screw it up.   You don't want anyone else messing with the situation, and so far the League has let that stand.
% This almost makes me want to have the Hero League try to *force* someone into \pCityO{}.  

That said, you and \cOldest{} \emph{are} constantly in a subtle war for control over \pCityO{}, trying to gain the upper hand over each other.  Right now \cOldest{} has a bit of an edge, but you think with the right word to the right people in the police department back home, you might be able to have an edge when you get back to \pCityO{}.
