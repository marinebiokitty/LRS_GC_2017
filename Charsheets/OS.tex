\name{\cOS{}}
You are \cOS{\intro}, the nationally-known \cOS{\hero} of \pCityO{}, defender of its citizenry and upholder of its laws...sort of.

You first set foot in \pCityO{} twenty-two years ago, a young \cOS{\hero} trying to find \cOS{\themself}, and find a cause.  You quickly became aware of the presence of a shadowy villain, \cOldest{\intro}, and went forth to confront them openly.  You found yourself locked in combat with \cOS{}, brawling through the streets of \pCityO{}, wielding your power over electricity against \cOldest{\their} powers over ice.  You battled for hours, until you finally wrestled \cOldest{\them} to the ground -- and then you found yourselves locked into a passionate embrace.  What can you say?  For a villain, \cOldest{} is dashing, audacious, and...quite attractive, honestly.

A strange sort of relationship blossomed.  You have always been on opposite sides of the battle for good and evil, and you are constantly striving with \cOS{\them} for control of the streets of \pCityO{}, but you can't bring yourself to do \cOS{\them} any lasting harm, and the times you've managed to tie \cOS{\them} up -- or \cOS{\they} have tied you up -- have ended in a bedroom, not a cell.

Nine months after that first encounter, you both had a surprise -- a \cGrad{\offspring}, \cGrad{\intro}.  You and \cOS{} negotiated a part-time truce -- a few days a week -- to try to have some sort of relationship, and raise your \cGrad{\offspring}.  The effectiveness of that arrangement has waxed and waned over the years, largely due to the amount of time you spend fighting, and the amount of time you spend in the bedroom.  Or on the roofs of buildings.  It's that sort of a relationship.  As a result, you've both often overlooked \cGrad{}; you almost didn't notice when \cGrad{} went off to college.  You've noticed now, though, that \cGrad{} has graduated and come back.  You're not sure why they haven't gone off to become a hero \emph{or} a villain -- instead, they're hanging around \pCityO{}, bouncing around the house you share with \cOS{} when you're not fighting.  You're not sure what, exactly, \cGrad{\theyare} doing around there, but you have other things to worry about.
