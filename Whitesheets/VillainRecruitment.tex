Congratulations, superhuman, for considering using your powers for villainy!  Being a supervillain can be tough, but joining the \cVillainCompact{\intro} can make it much easier.  Benefits include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Full medical benefits!
\item Expert legal assistance!
\item Superpowered assistance in escaping jail!
\item Truce status with all other members of the \cVillainCompact{}!
\item Help finding experienced, trained minions!
\end{itemize}

To join the \cVillainCompact{}, you must have the endorsement of a current \cVillainCompact{} member.

Leaving the \cVillainCompact{\intro} and becoming an unaligned superhuman carries a small fee of \$10,000.  Please deliver the money by cash or check to any bank.  % have an open sign envelope in game representing the bank?

Note: Joining the \cVillainCompact{} is forbidden to those who have been members of the \cHeroLeague{\intro} earlier in the same day, even if you have since become unaligned.
