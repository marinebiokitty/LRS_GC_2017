Congratulations, young superhuman, for considering using your powers for evil!  Being a supervillain can be tough, but joining the Villain Compact can make it much easier.  Benefits include

\begin{itemize}
\item Full medical benefits
\item Expert legal assistance
\item Superpowered assistance in escaping jail
\item Truce status with all other members of the Compact
\item Help finding experienced, trained minions
\end{itemize}

If you're considering becoming a villain, it's simple!  Raise your hands to the sky and let forth your most evil laugh.  Our weather-controlling members have arranged for a crack of thunder to accompany you, should you desire it.  Describe your villainous desires and schemes in a monologue lasting up to ninety seconds.  All in the same room will have no choice but to stay in the room and listen to you without interrupting.  At the end of your speech, announce: ``I, <\textit{My Name Here}>, declare myself a member of the Villain Compact, under the supervillain name <\textit{New Super Name Here}>!''

Leaving the League of Heroes and becoming an unaligned superhuman carries a small fee of \$10,000.  Please deliver the money by cash or check to a GM.

Note: Joining the Compact is forbidden to those who have been members of the League of Heroes earlier in the same day, even if you have since become unaligned.
