Congratulations, young superhuman, for considering using your powers for good!  As we all know, the best way to become a hero is to join the \cHeroLeague{\intro}.  Benefits include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Full medical benefits!
\item Liability insurance for collateral damage on civilians and buildings!
\item Strong relations with government and police!
\item Free counseling services!
\end{itemize}

To join the \cHeroLeague{}, you must have the endorsement of a current \cHeroLeague{} member.  Once you have that in hand, you can make a heroic speech to become a hero!

Due to insurance policies, leaving the \cHeroLeague{} and becoming an unaligned superhuman carries a small fee of \$10,000.  Please deliver the money by cash or check to any bank.

Note: Joining the \cHeroLeague{} is forbidden to those who have been members of the \cVillainCompact{\intro} earlier in the same day, even if you have since become unaligned.

\textit{If you decide to become a hero, pick up an envelope from \sBecomeHero{} and open it for instructions on how to make a heroic speech.}
