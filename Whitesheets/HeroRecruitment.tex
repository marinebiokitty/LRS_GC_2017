Congratulations, young superhuman, for considering using your powers for good!  As we all know, the best way to become a hero is to join the \cHeroLeague{\intro}.  Benefits include

\begin{itemize}
\item Full medical benefits
\item Liability insurance for collateral damage
\item Strong relations with government and police
\item Counseling
\end{itemize}

Due to insurance policies, leaving the \cHeroLeague{} and becoming an unaligned superhuman carries a small fee of \$10,000.  Please deliver the money by cash or check to any bank.

Note: Joining the League is forbidden to those who have been members of the Villain Compact earlier in the same day, even if you have since become unaligned.
