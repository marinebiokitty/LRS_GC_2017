Congratulations, young superhuman, for considering using your powers for good!  As we all know, the best way to become a hero is to join the League of Heroes.  Benefits include

\begin{itemize}
\item Full medical benefits
\item Liability insurance for collateral damage
\item Strong relations with government and police
\item Counseling
\end{itemize}

If you're considering becoming a hero, it's simple!  In the presence of a member in good standing of the League of Heroes, put your hand over your heart and make a speech  about a moral issue deep to your heart, such as the wrongness of stealing, the importance of family, or the importance of loyalty.  Your speech may last up to ninety seeconds, and everyone in the room must stay in the room and pay attention for the duration of your speech.  At the end of your speech, announce: ``I, <\textit{My Name Here}>, declare myself a member of the League of Heroes, under the superhero name <\textit{New Super Name Here}>!''

Due to insurance policies, leaving the League of Heroes and becoming an unaligned superhuman carries a small fee of \$10,000.  Please deliver the money by cash or check to a GM.

Note: Joining the League is forbidden to those who have been members of the Villain Compact earlier in the same day, even if you have since become unaligned.
