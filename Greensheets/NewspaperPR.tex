\name{\gNewspaperPR{}}

As a reporter you can publish stories with your very own secret PR mechanic. It is very key that you keep your reporter status secret, do everything should be done discreetly. 

You may publish stories for other people once they have found out your identity. 

As a freelance superhero, you currently cannot use the PR apparatus of the League or the Compact. However, should you decide to declare you may continue to publish and use the the HQ's PR department simultaneously.  

To break a story you do the following:

\item Write down the story on a white sheet labeled Press Release that exists for this purpose. 

\item Write down Associated Press as the person breaking the story. You must indicate the name of the other character publishing the story if you are publishing this for someone else. 

\item Roll a d6. Record as the Spin. Choose +/- 1 to modify your result. Record this number as the Modifier. 

\item Deposit the press release in the envelope attached to the sign for a \sWallPhone{}. 

\item Tell a GM you have sent off a press release.

\item The GM then goes and gets the story from the packet, reviews the Spin and Modifier and adjusts a "Public Opinion" number that represents general public opinion on Heroes, and publicly posts the story on a news board. 

Keep in mind that you have been slowly whittling away at the League's image for a few years as part of your revenge for the Chicago Incident, but you're still not too sure if you want it to plummet into the negatives. That would affect many of the superheroes not on the Council and the life of \cYoungest{}.  Decide your moves accordingly.
