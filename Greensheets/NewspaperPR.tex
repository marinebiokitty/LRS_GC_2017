Upholding the public image of the League of Heroes is of utmost importance to superheroes! 
Dragging the League's name through the mud is of high interest to all villains. Either way, gossip is power. 

The reputation of the League of Heroes is currently at a +5, which neither good nor bad. However, if it goes into the negatives the League is going have a PR crisis. 

Heroes or Villains who have declared for a side may call their HQ and ask their PR department to take a story to the press. This option is only available to characters who have declared for a team, but once you are declared there is no limitation on how many stories you can leak. There is also no limitation to what you can leak, but we ask that player exercise their common sense and keep it plausible. 

The player themselves have very minimal control over how the story breaks, but the way the story comes out will always benefit the Team (H/V) breaking the news. News will be broken in the order that the GMs receive stories. Even if the GMs receive the same story twice, both stories will be published. 

To break a story you do the following:
Write down the story on a white sheet labeled Press Release that exists for this purpose. Do not be profligate! 
Write down your name as the person breaking the story. You may not lie. 
Roll a d6, Add any modifiers you have. Record this number as "Spin"




Internet
This option is only available to Tween.
Anyone can approach Tween and get them to post something to the internet under a pseudonym. (It is role play to figure out who is the internet leak). Tween has ultimate control over the spin (Tween picks the modifier.)

Newspaper
This option is available only to YS
Anyone can approach YS and get them to submit an article to their publisher. (It is role play to figure out who the journalist is.) YS has ultimate control over the spin (YS picks the modifier.)




Deposit the press release in the envelope attached to the sign for your HQ (if you have one). If you aren't part of a team, you can't break a story unless you have another way to get information out.  [we then give Tween and YS abilities that allow them to deposit press releases in innocuous signs that say things like "A computer" or "A wall phone", or even just "Sign I" and "Sign N" or something]
Tell a GM you have sent off a press release.
The GM then goes and gets the story from the packet, reviews the spin number, modifies a "Public Opinion" number that represents general public opinion on Heroes, and publicly posts the story on a "news board". Tween and YS can publish anonymously, or list the name of the person who gave them the story instead of using their own name if they want. 
Heroes want to bring that number up, Villains want to bring that number down.  On the "You are a hero" blue sheet you add a goal that says "keep Public Opinion of the Hero league high," and to the villains that they want to lower that number.  And possibly specify that whichever hero wants to break the real story about the coverup of the Chicago incident values that above Public opinion of the hero league.
Modifiers to PR Mechanic:
Values that can be rolled on the die range from 1-6. With modifiers, you could technically get values as low as -2 or as high as 8; we'd list a full chart with all of the options and their impact. We publicly list the impact of each die value (i.e.: a value of 2 on the die is worth -2 points to the PO number.)
Submitting a story to your HQ automatically provides a modifier that benefits that group's goal (Hero league is +1 to die roll, Villain compact is -1 to die roll).
Submitting a story through Tween or YS gives them the option to +/- 1 from the die roll at their discretion.

If one of your adult superhero or supervillain relatives endorses you, that counts as worth \$20,000.  Only one endorsement adds value.
Public opinion of heroes and villains will move by 1 in the endorser's preferred direction.
