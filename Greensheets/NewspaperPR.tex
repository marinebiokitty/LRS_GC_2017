You've been slowly whittling away at the League's image for a few years, but you're still not too sure if you want it to plummet into the negatives. The reputation of the League of Heroes is currently at a +5, which neither good nor bad. However, if it goes into the negatives the League is going have a PR crisis.

As a reporter you can publish stories with your very own secret PR mechanic. It is very key that you keep your reporter status secret, do everything should be done discreetly. You may publish stories for other people once they have found out your identity. 

To break a story you do the following:
Write down the story on a white sheet labeled Press Release that exists for this purpose. 
Write down your name as the person breaking the story, if you are breaking this story under your reporter name, please write your reporter alias. Please indicate the name of the other character publishing the story if you are publishing this for someone else. 
Roll a d6, Add any modifiers you have, +/- 1 Record this number as "Spin"
Deposit the press release in the envelope attached to the sign for a Wall Phone. 
Tell a GM you have sent off a press release.
The GM then goes and gets the story from the packet, reviews the spin number, modifies a "Public Opinion" number that represents general public opinion on Heroes, and publicly posts the story on a news board. 

Modifiers to PR Mechanic:
Values that can be rolled on the die range from 1-6. With modifiers, you could technically get values as low as -2 or as high as 8; we'd list a full chart with all of the options and their impact. We publicly list the impact of each die value (i.e.: a value of 2 on the die is worth -2 points to the PO number.)
Submitting a story to your HQ automatically provides a modifier that benefits that group's goal (Hero league is +1 to die roll, Villain compact is -1 to die roll).
