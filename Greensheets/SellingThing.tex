Anyone can sell things on online hub E-Bae, if the object in question has a price. If it is something priceless! such as your spouse, don't sell them. Pricing will be done in increments of \$10,000 and should be clearly marked. If there is no reference to price then this item is not sellable. As long as the item is in your possession you can sell it.  

Once you have decided to sell this item, it will no longer be in-game and cannot be bought back from out of game. Trading the item in-game for in-game money does not fall under this category.  

To sell, bring the item to a GM and exchange for currency. Use your newfound money wisely!
