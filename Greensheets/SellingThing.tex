Anyone can sell things on online hub E-Bae, if the object in question has a price. Pricing will be in increments of \$5,000 and will be clearly marked. If there is no reference to price then this item is not sellable. If it is something priceless, such as your spouse, don't sell them.  As long as the item is in your possession, you can sell it. 

Once you have decided to sell this item, it will no longer be in-game and cannot be bought back from out of game. Trading the item in-game for in-game money does not fall under this category.  

To sell, bring the item to a GM and exchange it for currency. Use your newfound money wisely!
