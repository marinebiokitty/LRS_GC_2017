As \cTween{} the internet extraordinaire, you can break stories through the Internet! At first they will be whatever stories you want to publish, but if others find out you are honor-bound to let the Internet know the truth. However, you have to try and keep this on the down low otherwise the family might connect this to your IntheKnow activities. The less people that know, the better. 

Anyone can approach you and get you to post something to the internet under your pseudonym, but you have control over the Spin of the story. 

To break a story you do the following:
Write down the story on a white sheet labeled Press Release that exists for this purpose. Either you or the other player who wants to break the story can write it. 
Write down your internet alias as the person breaking the story.  
Decide on the "Spin" number. You may add +/-1 to the Modifier. 
Deposit the press release in the envelope attached to the Computer. 
Tell a GM you have sent off a press release.
The GM then goes and gets the story from the packet, reviews the spin number, modifies a "Public Opinion" number that represents general public opinion on Heroes, and publicly posts the story on a "news board". 

This does not affect your ability to go through any HQ PR department if you declare for a side, you can go on doing both.
