If a player comes to you from instructions behind \iArtworkThree{}, if they are not a grandkid, tell them they don't see anything interesting.
If they are a grandkid, ask them for the four digit code.  If they say 1962, tell them they see a sign that says: 
``Steal the \iBagofHolding{} that belongs to \cOS{} and bring it to me. The first person who presents it to me will win the grand prize!''
If they don't know the password, or get it wrong, tell them they are tased and cannot use electronics for two minutes.
They can get tased repeatedly, if they keep getting it wrong!
%{\em If you are not one of \cGrandma{}'s grandchildren, this is completely uninteresting.}

\cChrisHemsworth{\intro} instructions:\\
A player who enters Grandma's lair will find instructions to get a GM.  When they come to you, tell them,
``Once your eyes adjust to the darkness in the lair, you see the form of \cChrisHemsworth{\intro}, locked into a block of steel, with a sign saying Try Me.''

\cChrisHemsworth{} will ask the riddle: ``what has cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish?'' The answer is a map, which should lead them to \iArtworkThree{}.  They must tell Chris the answer.  When they get it right, Chris should tell them to wait ten minutes (by GM kludge), and then go find the map.
