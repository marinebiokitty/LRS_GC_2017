\name{\gTinkering{}}

In order to build a new item, first go to GM and ask how much the item will cost. Then bring two or more items that are tinkerable (items will be labeled as such) equaling or exceeding the established amount to the GM. You will likely need to steal these items.  

The GM will then make an item card for you. Spend 30 seconds role playing the making of the item in an impressive and flashy way. This is an uninterruptable action. When you are finished roll 1 d6.  If you roll a 1-2, your item short circuits and fills the room with smoth. You may try to rebuild the item after 10 minutes. 

*If you have one tinkerable item and enough cash then you can still build the item, but it will take more as you need to order an item. Tell the GM what you can to make, show the GM your one tinkerable item, and give the remaning cash. Wait 10 minutes and come back to the GM. The GM will then give you the item card and you can proceed to make the item. 

% Items in game will be labled as tinerkable. 
%At least a few items known ahead of game: freeze ray for $30K?
%Super sewing machine: maybe $20K
%Automatic lock picker: $40-50K
