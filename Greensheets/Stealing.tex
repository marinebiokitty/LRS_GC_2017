\name{\gStealing{}}

Signs that represent in-game items in game space that are stealable will be labeled as such. Each stealable item will have a target number. Roll 1 d6 and add your stealth score.  If the number exceeds the target then you steal the item. If you fail, you must wait 2 minutes before trying again.

To steal an item from a person, you must put 2 stickers on their back. The stickers can only go on one at a time. The stickers must be put on 5 minutes apart. If successful, you can search their items and take one.
