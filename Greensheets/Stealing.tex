\name{\gStealing{}}

All in-game items are stealable unless marked otherwise.  

To steal an item sitting in game space, stand in front of it for twenty seconds, then roll a d6.  If you get $\ge 3$, take the item. If you fail, you must say "Oops!" (or the like) in a normal-volume speaking voice, and wait 2 minutes before trying again.

To steal an item from a person, you must put two stickers on their back without them noticing.  
If the player notices you trying to place a sticker, they see your hand trying to reach into their pockets, the number of stickers is reset to zero and you must wait another two minutes before making another try.  
The stickers can only go on one at a time, and you must wait two minutes before placing a second sticker.  Once you place the second sticker, you can either search that character's items and take one.  (That character is not aware in-universe that they were stolen from or who stole from them.)

You cannot steal money, only items.  (In this game, money represents assets in remote bank accounts, not physical cash.)
