\name{\bWorld{}}
You live in a world of superhumans.  Many of these superhumans -- almost all of them -- identify as either a hero, someone who protects civilians and property and respects the law, or a villain, someone who often sees cities as territory to be taken and controlled, and the civilians in it as useful laborers or, often, potential sources of income.  The heroes and villains both have their own national organizations: the League of Heroes, and the Villain Compact.  Members of the League of Heroes often receive government support and are indemnified against the cost of property damage caused during fights with villains.

Though heroes are generally viewed as upstanding defenders of the innocent, many villains are seen as independent, audacious, charming, and savvy.  Many civilians might not even mind living under a villain with a light touch -- is a little protection money really different from one more tax?

The presence of superpowers often runs in families, though even related superhumans usually exhibit completely unrelated powers.  It is not unknown, however, for unpowered humans' children to develop superpowers.

Even superhumans have lives and families, however, and sometimes need to take time off.  Generally, they will hire city-sitters -- minions, extra security forces, or more often, younger or D-list superhumans who can at least take care of simple tasks.  City-sitting is highly valued in the resum\'e of a young hero or villain, and is often expected of young superhumans before they take responsibility for a territory of their own.

The public often finds superhumans fascinating, and often considers them celebrities in their own right, with the League of Heroes and Villain Compact often in competition for public opinion.  The Internet abounds with rumors, news, fact and (fan)fiction.  The most popular rumor site about superhumans on the Internet is \pTweenwebsite{}.The Super Know is a one-stop website for all things super.
