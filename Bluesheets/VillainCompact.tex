The Villain Compact formed decades ago as a loose alliance of villains.  While not all villains are part of the Compact, there are many benefits to joining.  For example, members of the Compact

\begin{itemize}
\item agree not to muscle in on each other's territory
\item agree to assist each other in escaping prison
\item benefit from the Compact's experienced medical teams, if hurt after battle with a hero
\item can share references for experienced minions
\end{itemize}

The Compact has offered a head start to many a young villain, often through the \textbf{Junior Villains League}.  The League helps would-be villains workshop a villain name, learn to pick locks, master a menacing laugh, and sometimes, find placement as a sidekick to a more experienced villain.
