\name{\bChicagoIncident{}}

The regulations regarding in-training Super Heroes are very stringent in what is and is not permissible. At one time, in-training Super Heroes were permitted to go on patrols on their own, but this is not longer the case. 

The reason stems back to the incident thirteen years ago in the \pCityO{}. Surge and \cJuggernaut{}, in-training Super Heroes, from \pSuperSchool{} were doing on site training in \pCityO{}. Their mentor \cOS{\MYsupername} went on rounds and left them alone. A small group of villains appeared and started a bank robbery. Goaded on by Surge, the two in-training super heroes went to assist in the bank robbery. \cJuggernaut{} acquitted himself well, but the circumstances changed quickly. Surge recklessly used \cYS{\their} power to over charge \cJuggernaut{} in a populated urban center of \pCityO{}. The property and human life damage was extensive. Property damaged registered in the millions. Dozens of innocent by-standers were injured and one of well-known Hero, \cAS{}, was killed while off duty. Subsequent investigations found that Surge was at fault for unauthorized, reckless power use and \cOS{\MYsupername} was found negligent in supervision. 
Afterward, any pre-in-service training member of the League of Heroes must complete a 3 month class on safety before having access to internships and mentorships with other heroes.
