The regulations regarding in-training superheroes are very stringent in what is and is not permissible. At one time, in-training superheroes were permitted to go on patrols on their own, but this is not longer the case. Thirteen years ago in the \pCityO{}, Surge and \cJuggernaut{}, in-training Super Heroes, from \pSuperSchool{} were doing on site training in \pCityO{}. Their mentor \cOS{\MYsupername} went on rounds and left them alone. 

A small group of villains appeared and started a bank robbery. Goaded on by Surge, the two in-training super heroes went to assist in the bank robbery. \cJuggernaut{} acquitted himself well, but the circumstances changed quickly. Surge recklessly used \cYS{\their} power to over charge \cJuggernaut{} in a populated urban center of \pCityO{}. The property and casualties were extensive. Property damaged registered in the millions. Dozens of innocent by-standers were injured and one of well-known hero, \cAS{}, was killed while off duty. Subsequent investigations found that Surge was at fault for unauthorized, reckless power use and \cOS{\MYsupername} was found negligent in supervision. Afterward, any pre-in-service training member of the \cHeroLeague{\intro} must complete a class on safety before having access to internships and mentorships with other heroes.
