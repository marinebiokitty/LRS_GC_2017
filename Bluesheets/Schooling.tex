Everybody has to go to high school and young Super teens are no exception. \pSuperSchool{} is a four year boarding school that serves a 1400 member student body. Students must pass a curriculum that is compliant with the US Department of Education Guidelines and receive a degree that is accepted at all accredit universities. Students with Super abilities are taught how to handle and control them safely. They receive a certification to use their power outside of school during their lives. Students also have electives including learning to apply their abilities to trades and industrious uses.  If students join the Heroes' League, they received special training in how to use their powers to help the police keep the peace and gain access to internships with various heroes. 

There are two groups of Super powers. Group one contains teens with physical powers, such as fire, water, or flight, or mental abilities that affect the physical world, such as object levitation or persuasion, must attend \pSuperShool{}. Group two contains teens with improved sense or mental capacity, such as sharp eye sight or lightening calculation may attend \pSuperSchool{} or a normal school of their choice.
