\bigquote{``For the Greater Good''}

The \cHeroLeague{\intro} began as an alliance of heroes in the major cities. It ensures each city with a major villain is also countered with a capable hero. Heroes may take side-kicks, but only after the side-kick is fully vetted by the \cHeroLeague{}. 

The \cHeroLeague{} is controlled by a Council, members of which are nominated by fellow Council members and voted in by heroes in the \cHeroLeague{} each term. The Council is tasked to make the decisions for the the rest of the \cHeroLeague{}, mediate conflicts, and deal with Public Relations. The Council is composed various members who deal with issues such as risk management, recruitment, socializing, or community service amongst many things. Good PR is the most important thing for the \cHeroLeague{} to maintain, at least above a 0 on the PR scale. Otherwise, there will be consequences for individual heroes and the League itself. This means that all members of the \cHeroLeague{} must stick to supporting any press releases the Council has published. Everything else goes in the \cHeroLeague{} Archive.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \cHeroLeague{} pays for your expenses if you file them correctly. 
\item You are responsible for mentoring and recruiting a certain number of heroes.
\item Benefit from the \cHeroLeague{}'s experienced support teams.
\item Excellent side-kick referral service. 
\item Awesome clubhouse-HQ.
\item Great parties.
\end{itemize}

The \cHeroLeague{} is where all heroes have their start, with a suitable mentor, and is where they get their cities and assignments. There is no Junior League, although heroes who are minors are welcome to make their own teams, such as the fabled Super 5!.  Minors can be part of the \cHeroLeague{} as long as they are sponsored by a full fledged member. Full-fledged members take turns hosting new-members for brief amounts of time so that they can learn a variety of skills.
