The Hero League began as an alliance of Heroes in the major cities. It ensures each city with a major villain is also countered with a capable hero. Heroes may take side-kicks, but only after the side-kick is fully vetted by the League. 

The League is controlled by a Council, members of which are nominated by fellow Council members and voted in by heroes in the League each term. The Council is tasked to make the decisions for the the rest of the League, mediate conflicts, and deal with Public Relations. The Council is composed the President, Vice President, Recruitment Chair, Hero Educator, Risk Manager, Treasurer, House Manager, Social Chair, Secretary, Philanthropy and Community Service Chair. Good PR is the most important thing for the League to maintain. This means that all member of the League must stick to the "story" that the Council decides on. Everything else goes in the League Archive.

The League is where all heroes have their start, with a suitable mentor and is where they get their cities and assignments. There is no Junior League although heroes who are minors are welcome to make they're own teams. Minors can be part of the League as long as they are sponsored by a full fledged member. New members are accepted in cohorts, around 3-6 people, and they are expected to work together and develop their powers with their cohort before being assigned their own city or official team. Full-fledged members take turns hosting cohorts and may mentor specific heroes if they wish but there is no expectation that they develop any kind of bond. Some popular full fledged heroes may have multiple cohorts each year.
